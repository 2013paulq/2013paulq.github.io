Humans are the first species to reach sentience and the first species to create a vast array of technology. The discovery of oil, a byproduct of ancient forests living and dying for millions of years, led us from a long period of slow development to a massive rapid expansion in all sectors. But we humans are not yet as intelligent as we think we are. We advanced at different rates depending on where we were. The lucky few experienced a supercharged rocket to extremely comfortable conditions, at the cost of the unlucky masses. Oil allowed us to develop exponentially. We could grow more food, build larger structures, create new materials, and travel at high velocities. But it came with a price. As we devoured this substance, the byproduct of that use became a gas that superheated the atmosphere of our little planet. But we humans are a silly species. The lucky few, driven by greed and hatred, manipulated the rest of us, told us lies and suppressed the truth. We did not know until it was too late that our oil-dependent lifestyles were causing our own demise. Now we know. Our dependence on oil might have cost us this fertile biologically diverse planet. We might have gone too far, used too much, but the changes are subtle and slow and we don't live long enough, individually, to notice them. This year might have been the last year we had to turn it all around, but still we are doing nothing. Still the majority of our species wants to ignore the science in the name of their comfort. Giving up oil means giving up luxuries that we have grown to expect, and we are a lazy species. We're not all going to survive what happens next.

Wie schon auf der Webseite beschrieben, ist die Menschheit in der Lage gravierende Einflüsse auf ihre Umgebung zu nehmen und das tut sie massiv. Nicht aus böser Absicht, sondern allein durch die Tatsache, dass mehr als 7 Milliarden Menschen auf der Erde irgendwo wohnen wollen, Nahrung und Wasser benötigen, alle möchten irgendwie mobil sein und kommunizieren. Früher war das im menschenmöglichen Rahmen, als0 zu Fuß oder per Pferd oder einem anderen Reittier, Kommunikation fand sehr eingeschränkt statt. Heute mit Satellitenkommunikation und Flugzeugen ist die Menschheit zusammengerückt wie nie zuvor. Die Herausforderung bzw. die Frage ob die Menschheit die Zukunft gestaltet hängt von der Definition 'Gestaltung' ab. Gestalten tut jeder der eine Aktion auf diesem Planet durchführt bereits und nimmt Einfluss darauf, ähnlich den klassischen Zeitreisen-Experiment 'was wäre wenn dies oder das anders verlaufen wäre usw.' Hier könnte man einfach sagen, die Menschheit gestaltet einfach ungeplant, ob sie es will oder nicht. Definiert man 'Gestaltung' als willentlich geplant und gewünscht, so sind die Bestrebungen der Nationen noch sehr viel von Egoismus getrieben, sei es durch Ressourcen oder territoriale Ansprüche, um die Versorgung der eigenen Nation zu gewährleisten. Durch die vielfältigen wirtschaftlichen Handelsbeziehungen sind viele 'automatisch gezwungen' mehr und mehr zu kooperieren, denn negative Auswirkungen bekommen irgendwann alle mit, ob es nun das Ozonloch ist, die Klimaerwärmung (die meines Erachtens höchstens von der Menschheit unterstützt wird = ggf. schneller voran getrieben wird; Begründung in der Antarktis, bekanntlich der kälteste Erdteil und gleichzeitig größtes Süßwasserdepot, wuchsen mal Palmen! Ganz ohne uns Menschen = war alles schon mal da), Verknappung der Ressourcen wie Öl oder Wasser. Hier ist Zusammenarbeit gefragt. Im Kontext wird sehr oft eine dystopische Zukunft geschildert, doch es wird eines vergessen: der Erfindergeist von 7 Milliarden potentieller intelligenter Geschöpfe zeigt eine schier unendliche Quelle von Lösungen der 'Probleme', die wir heute noch als solche bezeichnen. Die Erfindung eines Nanoroboter die den menschlichen Körper reparieren können, glich vor 20. 30 Jahren an reine Utopie wurde jedoch schon erdacht und heute gibt es bereits erste erfolgreiche Versuche. So können wir heute gar nicht erahnen, was morgen oder nächstes Jahr bereits erfunden sein könnte, um das Energieproblem oder die Umweltverschmutzung oder die Herausforderungen unserer Zeit zu lösen. Das Potential liegt in uns und unseren Genen. Ob wir sie sinnvoll durch Erforschung verwenden werden wird sich zeigen, wenn die Nachricht der ESA beim Polarstern ankommt. Vielleicht ist es dann gar Star-Trek-mäßig schon soweit, dass es Überlichtraumschiffe dort hinschaffen, um die Nachricht dort selbst zu empfangen. Wäre das nicht eine Herausforderung? Den Weg ins All werden die Menschen eh bestreiten. Selbst der Mensch an sich, sein Körper und erst Recht sein Geist ist noch nicht vollständig erforscht. So wird uns die nächste Zeit sicher nicht langweilig werden, also packen wir's an.

Human being is undoubtedly the most tough, flexible and ingenious specie but we are still animals, scientifically, which are heavily dependent on their habitat, even more than other species which we consider primitive to us and neglect in our course of development. If we look at the temporal trajectory of human race and everything else on our planet, we can hardly ignore our dominance over everything and the wrath it has brought upon it. Our development can be broadly stated as that of \" Automation, connectivity, high grade energy, entertainment, weaponry and health care\" with little or no attention to other important aspects such as \" human population explosion, effects of technology on environment and human psychology and physiology,sustainable development and endangered species\" to name a few. It appears although we talk about these issues and some of us even do something about them, we still give such important issues the attention they deserve only when they affect us directly in present or in near future. We all are aware of global warming, increase in size of Sahara desert about three football fields per year due to desertification and desertification of habitable cities also, but these have just become topics of general knowledge and slow actions are being taken to counter them. Dried up to half dark polluted rivers, melting ice capes and disappearing species of animals and plants tells the saga of humans atrocities! I think the future after few hundred years would be like as they depict in fiction with almost total desertification of earth due to lack of vegetation and increase in temperature due to global warming and small populations of humans scattered around globe with lots of high-tech gadgets but with no beauty of nature in sight. Where when a son tells his father that he saw a bird today, it becomes a breaking news! I think that the exponential growth of human population is one of the biggest problems that have been plaguing our planet and I don't understand why these famous and learned personalities aren't talking about it! More people require more resources and in this uncontrolled population explosion, we may end up eventually devouring this whole planet! We may survive for long on alternative fuels but still the population will eventually be a problem as we won't have enough resources to make equipments for so many people to harness renewable sources of energy.Also the transition is slow from conventional fuel to renewable fuel and while we do it, earth is suffering from the mess we have created. Instead of finding new ways to accommodate this ever growing population and its need of resources, we should work together and find methods to cut it small and create a balance among all species on our planet. Harmony among nature and its all creatures seems the only way to thrive for longest. It's time we should understand what uncle Ben says in the movie Spiderman- \"With great power comes great responsibility\" This message will take 434 years to reach Polaris but in merely 100 years or so, nearly 60% of large carnivorous and 50% of large herbivorous animals will extinct due to our impacts on environment, as I read in a research conducted recently. I strongly believe that there is life out their on some other planets of our universe, so may this message give a vital piece of advice if someone receives it and successfully decode it! I hope its not too late for your people and planet to reform, just like it isn't for us, yet.","index":1012},{"continent":"Asia","country":"India","city":"New Delhi","latitude":28.6451532,"longitude":76.8105479,"text":"The global economy will totallly depend upon renewable energy resources in the next 3 decades.

Un giorno l’equilibrio della vita si spezzerà e l’intero mio pianeta diverrà un deserto inabitabile. Quel giorno si perderà la coscienza stessa dell'Universo. Quel giorno lo posso vedere, adesso. Non potrò sopravvivere al tempo, ma sento quel giorno dentro di me.

So, we have two possible avenues to pursue: live in the illusion of being able to understand and control the world around us; plan every second, at the expense of others, to be able to reach the summitor; or we can stop for a moment, be humble and accept to be all united by lack of knowledge. \"How will our present environmental interactions shape the future?\" The true question should be: what we leaving to the future? The quest of power that justifies perseverance of actions and activities, such as war, massacres, policy, which repeat their destructive consequences for ages now. We must work in favor of respect for all living beings. Past and present generations have been disposed at the sacrifice of a part of the created to achieve collective welfare. But we are not superior beings to decide who can live and who can die, instead we have to appreciate the beauty of reason to the service of Nature. Nature is the main theme of the past, present and future. Being human does not mean dominance, but Responsibility. Only when this will be a long-held, we will be able to embrace the Evolution and advance in progress, leaving to posterity bases on which to start and not to be rewritten.

Que se respete el medio ambiente no contaminando los océanos con plásticos, derrames de petroleo y pesca de arrastre. Que no se talen los arboles para ganar terrenos para alimentar tanto ganado, que genera cambios climáticos que aceleran el deterioro de nuestro planeta.

The word “entity” must be taken in the largest sense. It applies to physical entities as well as ideas, ideologies, social groups, economic enterprises or geographic regions. It also, and very unfortunately, applies to our planet taken as a whole. This gloomy perspective can be best demonstrated with a petri dish. It is a flat, round shaped, transparent and lidded plastic box containing agar and some other nutrients. Biologists commonly use such dishes to culture and identify bacteria. A drop of liquid containing a bacteria is inoculated, and after a period (usually 24 to 72 hours) in an oven, the number of growths (colonies) is counted, hteir diameter measured, etc., and specific bacteria can then be identified. Over the period mentioned above, the number of colonies grows exponentially, then sees a “plateau” followed by an inflexion point and a downward curve ending abruptly. That is when all colonies die, poisoned by their own toxins. A simple extrapolated view shows us that our planet is a giant petri dish. Population growth entails pollution that will eventually poison and suffocate us. We should not fool ourselves, this is inevitable. Or…is it? First and foremost, we can delay the onset (the end point), by managing our resources and controlling surplus, therefore limiting pollution. Can we avoid the onset altogether? Probably not, but at least a few generations after us will have time to, perhaps one day, emigrate to the stars.","index":2310},{"continent":"Asia","country":"Singapore","city":"Singapore","latitude":1.3147268,"longitude":103.7069319,"text":"By converting planet earth's carbon dioxide emission to others that is less harmful..","index":2311},{"continent":"Asia","country":"Singapore","city":"Singapore","latitude":1.3147268,"longitude":103.7069319,"text":"Change should have commenced decades ago if we truly cared for developing a sustainable future.

In the short term, and to the smallest scale, every environmental interaction has consequences, some more-so than others. Currently we pollute our rare cradle of life to such extent that we affect the weather and ecosystems everywhere on Earth. Global temperatures increase, ice-shelves that have remained stoic and unchanging over eons begin to crack and decay, and all the while we childishly bicker among ourselves about how to deal with this situation. It is all posturing with no action - simple words of confidence to lull the masses while the true issues are never addressed. We humans are extremely selfish in nature. We would like to think of ourselves as guardian of Earth, though in truth we are the greatest threat it has ever, or ever will, face. Our pollution and destruction will continue regardless of protests, disasters or pandemics, because it is in our nature to believe we have a right to do so. As I mentioned before, this is only in the short term - the truth is that we may be long gone by the time this is ever received elsewhere, if indeed it is. This issue is also extremely localised, being an issue solely of Earth, which in the grand scheme of things is one planet among billions in our observable universe. To the wider world, and the greater time, this is insignificant. But this is not the wider world, and this is not the greater time - this is the here and now, the time when we need to make real change and progress towards protecting our small home. I don't expect change, I don't believe that there will be a sudden shift in the status quo, but I do dare to dream it and to hope.

Pero nos encontramos ante un conjunto de cambios sin precedentes, algo que la Tierra nunca ha tenido que soportar: nunca antes ha contribuido la biosfera tanto a modelar el planeta, y mucho menos, una única especie. La industrialización del mundo en el que vivimos es la principal culpable, ¿pero nadie quiere vivir de nuevo en cuevas no? La cantidad de gases residuales que estamos incorporando a la atmósfera lleva ya décadas alterando el comportamiento del clima, mientras que la gente al cargo de crear las políticas respecto al uso sostenible de los recursos deniega la necesidad de hacerlo. Otro problema importante al que nos enfrentamos es el déficit energético: el carbón y el petróleo siguen siendo ampliamente usados, mientras que se cierran centrales nucleares por malinformación y sensacionalismo sobre los peligros que entrañan. Las energías renovables todavía requieren de muchísimo desarrollo para llegar a competir directamente con las fuentes anteriores, y ya no mencionar los reactores de fusión que solucionarían el problema en un abrir y cerrar de ojos. Si no reaccionamos pronto, estos cambios se volverán irreversibles: 2016 ha roto records, cada mes ha sido el más cálido desde que se tienen registros. La Tierra se recicla a sí misma constantemente pero de manera muy lenta, y o nos adaptamos nosotros a su ritmo, o será ella misma la que se ocupará de ponernos en nuestro sitio. El ser humano ha evolucionado para vivir en el entorno terrestre que conocemos, fuera de él, es muy vulnerable. Si alguien alguna vez lee este mensaje, deberá saber que habremos cambiado, para bien o para mal, o que tal vez ya no existamos.

We are essentially energy and the energy of every living being has an effect on its environment, at least on this planet, which may or may not exist, or be inhabitable by the time we are long gone and this transmission is received. All energy is connected and acts on other energy. We all leave a \"footprint,\" on the planet. Our star, the sun has an energy that makes life on earth possible. If earth were slightly closer, or further, that wouldn't be possible. Physically, life, all life, is so fragile. One day, the sun, like all stars, will burn out and life, whatever life is here in that time, will end. The moon, our satellite, her energy affects us as well. We see the \"footprint,\" she leaves in the waves of our oceans and the actual physical footprints we are able to leave due to gravity. All of the energy flowing on our planet, in our solar system, within our galaxy, and throughout the entire known universe has always been and always will be in some form, for we know energy cannot be created or destroyed. It changes form, but it remains, including this transmission. Will \"someone,\" receive and decipher in their language, the contents of our transmission and will it make sense in that future to whoever receives it? Knowing that one day life as we know it on our earth will end may make some pessimists wonder why any of this matters as far as a future impact. If we are talking about the near future, and those of our immediate descendants of the next couple of generations, then our interactions with the present environment matters because there will be a direct impact on all life present in that time. As far as the far flung future, there may or not be an earth that sustains life, but there certainly won't be if we continue on our current unsustainable destructive path. This includes pollution, the overuse of land for grazing livestock, and excessive water usage. As long as we argue about what impacts the environment and whether global warming is man-made or a natural part of a cycle of the end of an Ice Age, we won't be using our energy to really have a positive impact or reversing any damage already done. The truth is we don't know what this future will look like. Will humans be in it? Will we have reached the next stage in the evolutionary process?

Tourists travel to Australia’s northernmost island with hopes of wonderful dives, surf, and relaxation, but what most do not anticipate is the smell of millions of rotting lifeforms, the stench of an ecosystem being murdered just beneath the waves. Lizard Island hosts thousands of guests each year, but more importantly, the island, a sector of the Great Barrier Reef as a whole, is the home for 696 land wildlife species, 1,600 species of fish, 130 types of sharks and rays, and over 30 species of whales and dolphins, all of which are being killed as tourists lounge by one of Lizard Island Resort’s extravagant swimming pools. For years, Australia's Great Barrier Reef has been disintegrating, but as Richard Vevers, diver, photographer, and environmentalist, explains, the world is currently experiencing the largest case of reef degradation that has ever been recorded; this degradation is a result of human impact on the environment. Locations like Lizard Island are reeling as a result of this, whether humans feel it or not. Above sea level, resort guests are breathing easy; under the waves, “the hard corals [are] dead and covered in algae... The soft corals [are] still dying and the flesh of the animals [is] decomposing and dripping off the reef structure”.\nThe reefs are falling victim to near “complete ecosystem collapse”. While on land, we may not yet feel the full extent of the tragedy happening under the seemingly picturesque sea, soon, we will. The stench of millions of dying lifeforms will eventually break through the surface. It will creep into our air and travel into our noses and lungs. It will slide its way into our society, culture, economy, and lives with vigor and with no relent. Though this poison is contained below the surface today, it will not be so forever, and now, it is traveling faster than ever.\nLizard Island is not the only coral reef being destroyed by human activity. According to the piece “The Great Barrier Reef: a catastrophe laid bare”,“93% of the almost 3,000 individual reefs that make up the Great Barrier Reef have been touched by bleaching, and almost a quarter of coral over the entire reef has been killed by this year’s global bleaching event”. Bleaching, the phenomena referenced in the above statistic, refers to coral bleaching. Coral rely on a symbiotic relationship with algae living in its tissue and when temperatures are too warm, the algae is stripped from the coral, depriving it of its color and primary food source, resulting in increased susceptibility to disease.\nThe rise in global temperature as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions extends to oceans and water temperature elevates to a degree that the coral cannot withstand: “Since 1950 more than 90% of the excess heat our carbon emissions have trapped in the atmosphere has gone into the oceans”. While carbon dioxide absorbed by the oceans has slowed impacts of climate change in other realms, it is causing major problems for the seas. Due to bleaching events caused by high water temperatures coral will die unless given time to recover, time that has also been wrenched away by pollution present as a result of human emissions. Increased levels of acidity due to emissions reduce the skeletal density and linear growth rate of corals. In the Great Barrier Reef, from 1991-2007, a decrease in density and linear extension rate of the corals resulted in a 20% drop in growth rate. Furthermore, higher temperatures and acidity have also been correlated to stronger storms, which in conjunction with higher water levels, can cause destruction to both coral reefs and their ecosystems as well as human resources on a global scale.\nGlobally, coral reefs support 25% of all marine life. This marine life is in grave danger, as “75 percent of the world’s reefs are threatened,” a term that refers to both reefs that are essentially lost already and reefs that are still functioning, but are predicted to degrade quickly. The common denominator for these threatened reefs is one factor: humans. Humans have caused it, and impacts of coral reef degradation on society will only become more severe moving forward. Large portions of the world’s population rely on coral reefs for food and income. Annually, reefs are responsible for “nearly US$ 30 billion in net benefits in goods and services to world economies, including, tourism, fisheries and coastal protection”. Continued loss of coral will result in huge economic losses: a predicted 9.6 billion dollars from tourism and 5.7 billion from reef fishing annually. In response to these losses, solutions are being developed. Artificial reefs created with sunken ships meant to revive diversity are a prominent option being tested globally. However, an Australian study conducted in 2014 concluded that while some aspects of a young artificial reef mirror that of a natural reef, there are stark ecological differences which undermine immediate effectiveness. Other solutions focus on limiting further pollution from agricultural runoff, destructive fishing, unsustainable tourism, and overfishing. Still, the speed at which reefs are declining poses a major challenge for solution options. The irreversible damage humans have caused to global reef ecosystems is representative of both the “critical decade” and the anthropocene at large in that it demonstrates the juxtaposition between the human attitude of blissful ignorance and the environmental state of deterioration. The degradation of coral reefs reveals the tendency for humans to ignore what they cannot see; both literally and figuratively out of sight for most, coral reefs are representative of the anthropogenic era we live in. The reefs of Lizard Island reefs may never return to their once vibrant state. If drastic action is not taken to protect reefs worldwide, the putrid stench of rotting ecosystems will become the new norm.","index":3674},{"continent":"N.

Bill had no role in decreasing the water level as he hasn’t irrigated his crops for sixteen years. His neighbors have been growing corn, a lucrative, water intensive crop. The water is sourced from the Ogallala aquifer, freshwater stored in porous rock under the earth’s surface which underlies Nebraska, Kansas, the Oklahoma panhandle, and parts of Texas and New Mexico. The Ogallala’s life span is threatened as more water is being pumped out for irrigation than is being naturally replenished. The water in the Ogallala has been accumulating for 15,000 years, since before the end of the last ice age, and some areas are already depleted due to pumping throughout the past 60 years. 1 Scientists estimate that it may take 6000 years to refill the Ogallala. The water used to nourish our food is thus disturbingly finite. \nThe exploitation of the Ogallala mirrors a history of environmental manipulation in the Great Plains Region. In the early 1800s, homesteaders moved into the Great Plains region despite its inhospitable environment. The Dust Bowl, a catastrophe in which Midwestern crops failed en masse, ensued in the 1930s due in part to the loosening of topsoil because of agriculture. Despite the devastating effects of the Dust Bowl, farmers continued to grow thirsty crops in the arid region. The invention of the diesel-fueled centrifugal pump and the center-pivot sprinkler in the 1950s led to large scale agriculture in the Great Plains and mounting use of the Ogallala’s waters. Central-pivot irrigation dotted the Great Plains with lush green circles in the otherwise barren landscape. \nThe Ogallala is only one of many aquifers across the globe, and it is not the only one suffering from rapid overuse. The North China Plain is facing a water crisis due to a combination of intensive agriculture and burgeoning urban areas, such as Beijing. Surface water in this area is unreliable, and so farmers often turn to groundwater as an alternative. Approximately half of the communities in Northern China are thus facing falling groundwater table levels, impacting 50 to 100 million farming households. Throughout the North China Plain, water tables are dropping by about one meter per year. Moreover, growing urban areas and industrial operations in this region are competing with farmers for groundwater, further stressing the aquifers.\nThe Arabian Peninsula also faces water scarcity crises. Many rural villages and towns located in what are known as wadi valleys used to rely on shallow aquifers for their irrigation and drinking water needs. These supplies are no more, and thus the Saudi Arabian government is forced to provide water to these villages via desalination and transport, among other proposed options. Meanwhile, these villages have lost their agricultural way of life due to water depletion.\nEffects of aquifer depletion around the globe are varied and complex. Food production is and will be one of the hardest hit sectors as aquifers continue depleting. If the Ogallala dries up completely, “more than $20 billion worth of food and fiber will vanish from the world’s markets.” The depletion of water needed to produce the world’s food comes at an inopportune time as world populations grow exponentially. Additionally, depleting aquifers can create further political tension in already water-stressed areas. Some social scientists have partially attributed the Syrian Civil War to drought compounded with water stress. Jordan’s only freshwater source is aquifers, and they now have over a half billion Syrian refugees.\nThis crisis is solvable. Solutions will depend on the water-stressed region in question. For example, in the wadi villages, the Saudi government is debating desalination, treatment of contaminated water, or transportation of clean water from elsewhere. In Northern China, experts have proposed solutions such as harvesting precipitation for irrigation and using more efficient irrigation technologies. The latter solution could be applied to all areas that are water-stressed due to groundwater depletion. \nThese crises reveal a fundamental flaw in human judgment: a tendency to exchange long-term prosperity with short-term gains. Despite extensive knowledge of the ongoing water scarcity crisis, little to nothing is being done to effectively remedy the problem, although some governments are beginning to take note. This human detachment from the crisis at hand is a result of groundwater depletion’s relative invisibility; those who suffer most from it are the world’s poor, and mostly farmers. Perhaps, once the crisis becomes severe enough to affect larger masses of people, it will become visible enough to warrant sufficient action towards its remediation.","index":3675},{"continent":"N. America","country":"United States","city":"Saint Paul","latitude":44.9398077,"longitude":-93.1760938,"text":"For decades, the indigenous people of Brazil have had their rights compromised and their integrity violated in the pursuit of land that is deemed to have greater importance than their livelihoods, cultures, and traditions. Tribal lands have been stripped of vegetation and converted into plantations or cattle ranches that provide little economic stability to the people who previously inhabited these areas. The displacement and necessity-driven human migration that has resulted from these conversions brings with it not only a loss of pride and heritage, but often times even more urgent concerns related to health and basic survival.\nThese impacts are felt keenly by the Guarani, one of the largest groups of indigenous people in Brazil. The majority of the deforestation of ancestral lands is currently caused by the cattle industry, which brings with it its own set of hardships to the Guarani, including exploited labor. In order to keep the indigenous people from organizing and taking legal action against the cattle farmers, some ranchers have resorted to scare tactics, including the assassinations of tribal leaders. Recently, the Chief of the Guarani tribe and his two sons were killed in a very suspicious roadside accident. The cattle industry is a large proprietor of Guarani territory, illegally destroying acres of ancestral land. Countless Guarani people live in fear and uncertainty, their lives threatened by those who profit from the theft of land.\nThe livelihood of Brazil’s indigenous population has taken a backseat to deforestation. Since 1970, approximately twenty percent of The Amazon Rainforest has been cut down, more than in all the previous 450 years since European colonization began. Scientists fear that an additional twenty percent of the trees will be lost over the next two decades. If that is so, the forest's ecology will begin to unravel. Forests, such as the Amazon rainforest and the boreal forest in Russia, account for the largest natural sink of terrestrial carbon. The amazon is especially crucial to the process of carbon fixation, which is the process of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, because in a normal year the amazon can absorb as much as 2.2 billion tons of carbon, though that number is threatening to decrease.\nDeforestation has both short term and long term impacts, because it not only releases carbon back into the atmosphere, but also reduces the amount of carbon that is removed from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Deforestation also negatively impacts the trees that are still standing. The Amazon produces half of its own rainfall through the moisture it releases into the atmosphere, but eliminating enough of that rain through deforestation may dry out and kill the remaining trees. Furthermore, when desiccation is worsened by global warming, severe droughts raise chance of wildfires that could destroy the forest. In 2005, such a drought affected the Amazon, stranding communities and reducing river levels by up to forty feet. In addition, the burning of trees to create ranches for cattle or plantations has made Brazil one of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases.\nIt is old news that indigenous peoples have been taken advantage of by big industry, their suffering largely ignored by the public; why is this going to become a greater problem in the Anthropocene? By completely ravishing the Amazon and further perpetuating the carbon footprint of the meat industry, we are essentially promoting the idea that meat intake is of greater importance than the value of human life. This may sound contradictory in a human-centric world, but it actually isn’t. The causes of the Anthropocene only come from approximately twenty percent of the world’s population, and that twenty percent is from the Western world. As the Brazilian government sets its sights on doubling the beef industry by 2018, more deforestation is sadly inevitable. When powerful countries like the United States continue to profit off the deforestation and cattle ranching in the Amazon, we are forced to ask whose life matters more in the Anthropocene. Is it those who will need the meat to survive as crops become difficult to manage? Is it the impoverished indigenous tribe whose homicide and suicide rates are being wildly ignored? Since regrowing the Amazon that we have lost is not a viable option, breaking up industry cattle ranching and providing space for indigenous people to create economic viability might be a way to ensure that humans rights are maintained in the Anthropocene. As we move into this new era, environmental degradation and increased demand for resources will cause even more economic disparity than is already occurring worldwide. The key to sustainable movements is the emphasis of collectivism and the ensurance that humans are seen as more than just their economic potential.","index":3676},{"continent":"N.

We use plastic in virtually every aspect of our lives, and we eventually through every piece of it away. Much of it ends up polluting the environment along with other anthropogenic garbage. In the US alone, over twenty five billion tons of plastic go unaccounted for annually. In the ocean, this waste agglomerates through currents into massive swirling vortexes of trash, the largest of which is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch -- a transnational environmental disaster. \nThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch or GPGP occupies an area of the Northern Pacific Ocean estimated to be twice the size of Texas. It is made up of 80% plastic and 20% chemical waste and oil tarbar. The concentration of trash is so great in certain parts of the patch that six plastic particles exist for every one specimen of zooplankton. The GPGP formed as garbage was dumped into the ocean, mainly from the coasts of the United States and various Asian countries, as well as off of ships. This waste agglomerates in the North Pacific Gyre: one of five oceanic gyres around the world. These swirling vortexes of slow, deep currents immobilize anything without powered propulsion that enters them. These items can then remain in the currential spiral for decades, effectively creating a perpetually growing junkyard.\nPlastic is not biodegradable, but it does break down into smaller particles called microplastics: defined as being five millimeters or smaller. As plastic breaks down, it leaches harmful chemicals previously applied to it into the ocean, such as flame retardants. Other plastic debris in the ocean can absorb a large percentage of these toxic compounds. However, marine life often mistakes these now-toxic plastic pellets for fish eggs and ingests them. Marine life can also become entangled and trapped in the floating trash. Reports by UNEP raise concern for 267 species worldwide that may die from accidental entanglement in and ingestion of waste material in the oceans. Among these are “86 percent of all sea turtle species, 44 percent of all seabird species, and 43% of all marine mammal species”.\nThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch also poses a threat to human health and economies. Through a process called biomagnification, the concentration of plastic debris within an organism increases with each trophic level, so that the creatures at the top of the food chain ingest the highest amounts of these toxic contaminants: with regards to the ocean food chain, those creatures are humans. Once ingested, these harmful substances act as carcinogens and or endocrine disruptors, and thus pose a serious risk to human health. Furthermore, studies estimate that the overall economic loss to the tourism and fishing industries caused by marine pollution is between 223 and 539 million USD 8. This could seriously undercut the livelihoods of the 58.3 million people estimated to be engaged in “the primary sector of capture fisheries and aquaculture”, the majority of whom live in developing Asian and African countries.\nSome promising solutions have been proposed to remove the garbage in mass from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. These range from simple beach cleanups to a proposal from then nineteen-year old Boyan Slat to create a vast screen on the ocean surface which would capture floating plastic while marine life swam underneath. However, to date, few of these solutions have been put into effect. Even if they were, the problem still remains that vast quantities of humanity’s trash ends up in the ocean. The GPGP is just one of five ocean garbage patches: one exists at every gyre, and they all pose similar threats, albeit not necessarily on the same scale. \nThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch represents the extreme wastefulness not of a single country, but of the entire global consumerist culture. Every human produces some amount of trash that will one day end up in a gyre. Humanity as a species is united in its spreading of waste into the environment, and must now be united in its removal therein and prevention thereof. In the words of the discoverer of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, Charles Moore, “The future will have to eliminate products that make you need two or three more products. We want products that are the easiest to recycle, that are the least toxic, and the most cradle-to-cradle in terms of raw materials. I am [and indeed we as a species are] just beginning to formulate that concept.”","index":3677},{"continent":"N. America","country":"United States","city":"Saint Paul","latitude":44.9398077,"longitude":-93.1760938,"text":"Every spring, thousands of villagers flood the apple orchards of Maoxian Valley in Sichuan, China, armed with paint brushes and pots of pollen. In a period of only five days, they race to pollinate more than 200,000 Maowen apple trees, which by the end of the growing season will yield a harvest of the country’s leading cash crop. Before the region lost its entire native bee population due to habitat loss and pesticide use, this yearly rush would have never been necessary. In the United States, bee populations have undergone a similar decline, and seven bee species native to Hawaii have been placed on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Endangered Species List just this week. Every spring, millions of bee colonies are loaded into trucks and transported across the country to pollinate crops in order to maintain the nation’s food supply. The almond crops of California alone require 1.6 million domesticated bee colonies each growing season, and these bees only perform 14% of the pollination, the rest of which is completed by vulnerable native bee populations.\nThe bee population decline is global, and has human causes, implications, and potential solutions. There is some ambiguity about the direct causes of colony collapse disorder, but human-induced restriction of wild habitats and our use of pesticides contribute to the extermination of bees and reduce their fertility. The downward trend of world-wide bee populations poses a threat not only to bees, but to global biodiversity and the stability of human society. About 70 percent of crops produced today require a pollinator to reproduce and generate fruit; bees are ideal because they are abundant and their branched hairs improve the rate of pollen moving from plant to plant. Declining bee populations pose a severe threat to the global food supply because staple crops like corn are losing their main pollinator as the demand for food steadily rises. In the interval between the mid-1960s and the late 1990s, caloric intake per person per day increased by approximately 450 kcal, and global population has nearly doubled in the last 50 years.\nPotential solutions reflect broader ways that the Anthropocene may change our society and our choices. We are currently faced with a tradeoff between business as usual and drastic changes to our agricultural industry, a conflict applicable to many other human-induced environmental problems. To secure our food supply, we could immediately stop using pesticides that harm bees and hope that populations bounce back, or we could continue using them and develop new strategies for pollination without bees. These strategies may involve hand pollination, as seen in China, or the use of technology, like the transportation of colonies across the United States. More futuristic possible solutions include the development of “RoboBees,” tiny solar-powered robotic pollinators that would communicate with a central computer in order to collectively pollinate with the greatest possible efficiency which are currently being developed at the Wyss Institute at Harvard University. This technology raises questions about the role of technology in responding to the loss of crucial species for human survival and whether the implementation is sustainable. For instance, trucking bees across the U.S. solves the problem in the short term, but contributes carbon to the atmosphere, exacerbating global warming. RoboBees might be a more sustainable solution, but could disrupt local ecosystems. Should we save the world we live in now by halting pesticide use, or create a new world where technology acts as a crutch to our food supply?\nThe bee population decline generally illustrates our tendency to abuse the very resources we need to survive, over time rendering them no longer available to us. As a species, we prioritize the present over the future. We spray crops with pesticides before we understand their full effect. We have depleted the fossil fuel supply and become so dependent on petroleum products that our society will have to radically change in their absence. Recently, the state of South Carolina disseminated an aerial pesticide meant to kill Zika-carrying mosquitos, unintentionally killing millions of honeybees in the process. Unless we start thinking about the future and how we can keep the Earth safe and sustainable for future generations even if it means sacrificing convenience in the present, the human species may also become endangered like the bees.","index":3678},{"continent":"N.

I am called a human being, my name is Tim from the planet Earth. Earth is the 3rd planet from our sun located in the milky way galaxy. I would like to express my feelings in a matter that is very delicate to our world in our time, which is the month of july, on the 31st day in the year of our Lord 2016. Our species are in need of help. Our planet is need of help. The question proposed to our existence is this: How will our present environmental interactions shape the future? To try and answer this you must first know a little about our planet and race. According to our scientists, our planet has been around for 4.5 - 5 billion years While our ancestors have been around for about six million years, the modern form of humans only evolved about 200,000 years ago. Civilization as we know it is only about 6,000 years old, and industrialization started in the earnest only in the 1800s. So as a race in whole we may seem old, we are not! We are a very young race. We are very strong willed. We are very determined and family oriented and we have a Soul! Our race is full of emotions which drives our very existence. Human beings feel, they love, they hate and they forgive. Humans can band together for any reason. With 7 billion humans on our planet, and growing, our planets resources are being used in ways the planet has never experienced. The human race is expanding. Humans are reaching for the stars. Humans have this feeling we call curiosity. This makes us wonder what could or might be. So humans investigate, humans go beyond the possible, humans strive to be better, humans want to survive. Humans love Earth, yet the human race has been careless over the centuries. The planet, thanks to the human race, is becoming a factory for our race to better themselves. The human race today wants more out of life than just surviving. Humans try to do the impossible in order to better the human race. Yes, humans are violent, Yes humans are careless and destructive, and yes humans are predators. Humans will kill. Humans have faith. The human race believes in a supreme being that created the cosmos in turn created life. God is the creator. Humans believe that God is in heaven and when His son Jesus, returns to Earth, it will mean the end of times for the human race, as a body. Our God has promised the humans eternal life by means of a soul. The humans that believe this and accept Jesus as their savior will live forever in the kingdom of God. The humans that dont believe this, God promises an eternal life in Hell. A place for the damned. Ruled by Satan, an angel cast out of Heaven by God. The human race is very complex. The human mind is unpredictable, yet is so extraordinary. Humans are delicate and fragile as well as strong and forceful. Humans need help. The planet Earth needs help. The question i stated earlier cant be answered by a human. The human race needs an Ambassador, some Being to witness how and what we are doing to destroy our planet. Give our race advice and help to insure the human races' and the planets' survival. The human race is expanding, and yes the planet can hold and maintain zillions of humans, the planet just cant maintain humans' means of living. I believe that at the current rate we humans are devouring the planets resources, covering the planet with concrete, and destroying the planets oceans, forests, and atmosphere...The human race is putting itself on a course for planetary destruction. The human race needs help to be unified. Please help show us how to come together as ONE world. Not many nations and cultures, or race. All humans are flesh and blood. All humans are born, live and die. So until the human race can become as one, the question proposed cant be answered by a human.

The latest chapter of our story begins in England 250 years ago. Fuelled by coal, then oil, several brilliant inventions appeared. They ignited the industrial revolution which spread like wildfire through Europe, North America, Japan then elsewhere. The great railways then cars and highways connected people across the globe. Medical discoveries saved millions of lives. New artificial fertilisers meant we could feed more people. Population rose rapidly. But this was nothing compared with what was to come. The 1950’s marked the beginning of ‘the Great Acceleration’. Globalisation, marketing, tourism and huge investments helped fuel enormous growth. People swarmed to cities which became even more powerful engines of creativity. In a single lifetime, the well-being of millions has improved beyond measure. Health, wealth, security, longevity; never have so many had so much yet 1 billion are now malnourished. In a single lifetime we have grown into a phenomenal global force. We move more sediment and rock annually than all natural processes such as erosion and rivers. We manage three quarters of all land outside the ice sheets. Greenhouse gas levels this high have not been seen for over 1 million years. Temperatures are increasing; we have made a hole in the ozone layer. We are losing biodiversity. Many of the world’s deltas are sinking due to damming, mining and other causes. Sea level is rising. Ocean acidification is a real threat. We are altering Earth’s natural cycles. We have entered the Anthropocene; a new geological epoch dominated by humanity. This relentless pressure on our planet risks unprecedented destabilisation. But our creativity, energy and industry offer hope. We have shaped our past, we are shaping our present, we can shape our future. You and I are part of this story. We are the first generation to realise this new responsibility. As the population grows to 9 billion, we must find a safe operating space for humanity for the sake of future generations.
