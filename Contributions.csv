The discovery of oil, a byproduct of ancient forests living and dying for millions of years, led us from a long period of slow development to a massive rapid expansion in all sectors. But we humans are not yet as intelligent as we think we are. We advanced at different rates depending on where we were. The lucky few experienced a supercharged rocket to extremely comfortable conditions, at the cost of the unlucky masses. Oil allowed us to develop exponentially. We could grow more food, build larger structures, create new materials, and travel at high velocities. But it came with a price. As we devoured this substance, the byproduct of that use became a gas that superheated the atmosphere of our little planet. But we humans are a silly species. The lucky few, driven by greed and hatred, manipulated the rest of us, told us lies and suppressed the truth. We did not know until it was too late that our oil-dependent lifestyles were causing our own demise. Now we know. Our dependence on oil might have cost us this fertile biologically diverse planet. We might have gone too far, used too much, but the changes are subtle and slow and we don't live long enough, individually, to notice them. This year might have been the last year we had to turn it all around, but still we are doing nothing. Still the majority of our species wants to ignore the science in the name of their comfort. Giving up oil means giving up luxuries that we have grown to expect, and we are a lazy species. We're not all going to survive what happens next. If this message reaches anyone able to decipher it and come to see our destruction, you will likely either find Earth as a planet under siege by its own inhabitants, or devoid of life.

I am optimistic that we will, out of necessity, accomplish this. This is truly the most exciting time to be alive on planet Earth, with the technological innovations that make our lives both easier and increasingly challenging. We cannot go back, only forward; and the very technology that threatens to wreak havoc on the environment is also the only possible key to a very long term future. For the first time, life on Earth has the potential capability to avert the mass extinction arising from the next comet or asteroid that is on a collision course; or other inevitable natural mass extinction event. Over the next millennium we have the potential to colonize other planets and moons in the solar system, and so have our “eggs in more than one basket.” Interstellar travel is less likely for human life, but a conscious artificial intelligence that might emerge from our efforts will know no such bounds. I am therefore glad to be alive now, and optimistic for the future.

,,,-,,,,,,Shashank Tyagi,"Sometimes I ask myself this question, what is the goal of mankind. Religions and science have entirely different perspective on this thought, as the latter forbids the notion of God. But as we now live in an age of logic and human ingenuity, let's talk science! Science, as it appears has a simple answer to this question- "" keep on Surviving( or should I say thriving), inventing and discovering"". But are we really planning to thrive for long or just being impulsive & exploiting the resources nature bestowed on us! Human being is undoubtedly the most tough, flexible and ingenious specie but we are still animals, scientifically, which are heavily dependent on their habitat, even more than other species which we consider primitive to us and neglect in our course of development. If we look at the temporal trajectory of human race and everything else on our planet, we can hardly ignore our dominance over everything and the wrath it has brought upon it. Our development can be broadly stated as that of "" Automation, connectivity, high grade energy, entertainment, weaponry and health care"" with little or no attention to other important aspects such as "" human population explosion, effects of technology on environment and human psychology and physiology,sustainable development and endangered species"" to name a few. It appears although we talk about these issues and some of us even do something about them, we still give such important issues the attention they deserve only when they affect us directly in present or in near future. We all are aware of global warming, increase in size of Sahara desert about three football fields per year due to desertification and desertification of habitable cities also, but these have just become topics of general knowledge and slow actions are being taken to counter them. Dried up to half dark polluted rivers, melting ice capes and disappearing species of animals and plants tells the saga of humans atrocities! I think the future after few hundred years would be like as they depict in fiction with almost total desertification of earth due to lack of vegetation and increase in temperature due to global warming and small populations of humans scattered around globe with lots of high-tech gadgets but with no beauty of nature in sight. Where when a son tells his father that he saw a bird today, it becomes a breaking news! I think that the exponential growth of human population is one of the biggest problems that have been plaguing our planet and I don't understand why these famous and learned personalities aren't talking about it! More people require more resources and in this uncontrolled population explosion, we may end up eventually devouring this whole planet! We may survive for long on alternative fuels but still the population will eventually be a problem as we won't have enough resources to make equipments for so many people to harness renewable sources of energy.Also the transition is slow from conventional fuel to renewable fuel and while we do it, earth is suffering from the mess we have created. Instead of finding new ways to accommodate this ever growing population and its need of resources, we should work together and find methods to cut it small and create a balance among all species on our planet. Harmony among nature and its all creatures seems the only way to thrive for longest. It's time we should understand what uncle Ben says in the movie Spiderman- ""With great power comes great responsibility"" This message will take 434 years to reach Polaris but in merely 100 years or so, nearly 60% of large carnivorous and 50% of large herbivorous animals will extinct due to our impacts on environment, as I read in a research conducted recently. I strongly believe that there is life out their on some other planets of our universe, so may this message give a vital piece of advice if someone receives it and successfully decode it! I hope its not too late for your people and planet to reform, just like it isn't for us, yet.",X

L’erba che sarà cresciuta sulla mia tomba trasformerà in fiori gli elementi scomposti delle molecole del mio corpo, ed infine si perderà memoria del luogo della mia sepoltura. Un giorno la mia lingua sarà dimenticata e la mia città distrutta e ricostruita centinaia di volte. Un giorno non resterà che un lontano ricordo della civiltà in cui ho vissuto e di me si sarà perso per sempre ogni ricordo, nessuno saprà chi ero, come percepivo l'Universo e come ho vissuto la mia vita. Un giorno l’equilibrio della vita si spezzerà e l’intero mio pianeta diverrà un deserto inabitabile. Quel giorno si perderà la coscienza stessa dell'Universo. Quel giorno lo posso vedere, adesso. Non potrò sopravvivere al tempo, ma sento quel giorno dentro di me. Giuseppe Bonura ",

Where are we from? Where are we going to?"". They are blank question, because we are just passing through on this Earth. The only certainty we have is that our time is limited. So, we have two possible avenues to pursue: live in the illusion of being able to understand and control the world around us; plan every second, at the expense of others, to be able to reach the summitor; or we can stop for a moment, be humble and accept to be all united by lack of knowledge. ""How will our present environmental interactions shape the future?"" The true question should be: what we leaving to the future? The quest of power that justifies perseverance of actions and activities, such as war, massacres, policy, which repeat their destructive consequences for ages now. We must work in favor of respect for all living beings. Past and present generations have been disposed at the sacrifice of a part of the created to achieve collective welfare. But we are not superior beings to decide who can live and who can die, instead we have to appreciate the beauty of reason to the service of Nature. Nature is the main theme of the past, present and future. Being human does not mean dominance, but Responsibility. Only when this will be a long-held, we will be able to embrace the Evolution and advance in progress, leaving to posterity bases on which to start and not to be rewritten. What matter is to use our energies to promoting life. I think there are some mistakes in my english, but what is really wrong is not to get involved for fear of making a mistake and remain static in the security of our doing nothing.

,,,-,,,,FB,,Michel R. Lienard,"One of the most famous statements of Hegel (the Philosopher) is “Every entity contains in itself the germs of its own destruction”. The word “entity” must be taken in the largest sense. It applies to physical entities as well as ideas, ideologies, social groups, economic enterprises or geographic regions. It also, and very unfortunately, applies to our planet taken as a whole. This gloomy perspective can be best demonstrated with a petri dish. It is a flat, round shaped, transparent and lidded plastic box containing agar and some other nutrients. Biologists commonly use such dishes to culture and identify bacteria. A drop of liquid containing a bacteria is inoculated, and after a period (usually 24 to 72 hours) in an oven, the number of growths (colonies) is counted, hteir diameter measured, etc., and specific bacteria can then be identified. Over the period mentioned above, the number of colonies grows exponentially, then sees a “plateau” followed by an inflexion point and a downward curve ending abruptly. That is when all colonies die, poisoned by their own toxins. A simple extrapolated view shows us that our planet is a giant petri dish. Population growth entails pollution that will eventually poison and suffocate us. We should not fool ourselves, this is inevitable. Or…is it? First and foremost, we can delay the onset (the end point), by managing our resources and controlling surplus, therefore limiting pollution. Can we avoid the onset altogether? Probably not, but at least a few generations after us will have time to, perhaps one day, emigrate to the stars.",

In the short term, and to the smallest scale, every environmental interaction has consequences, some more-so than others. Currently we pollute our rare cradle of life to such extent that we affect the weather and ecosystems everywhere on Earth. Global temperatures increase, ice-shelves that have remained stoic and unchanging over eons begin to crack and decay, and all the while we childishly bicker among ourselves about how to deal with this situation. It is all posturing with no action - simple words of confidence to lull the masses while the true issues are never addressed. We humans are extremely selfish in nature. We would like to think of ourselves as guardian of Earth, though in truth we are the greatest threat it has ever, or ever will, face. Our pollution and destruction will continue regardless of protests, disasters or pandemics, because it is in our nature to believe we have a right to do so. As I mentioned before, this is only in the short term - the truth is that we may be long gone by the time this is ever received elsewhere, if indeed it is. This issue is also extremely localised, being an issue solely of Earth, which in the grand scheme of things is one planet among billions in our observable universe. To the wider world, and the greater time, this is insignificant. But this is not the wider world, and this is not the greater time - this is the here and now, the time when we need to make real change and progress towards protecting our small home.

Pero nos encontramos ante un conjunto de cambios sin precedentes, algo que la Tierra nunca ha tenido que soportar: nunca antes ha contribuido la biosfera tanto a modelar el planeta, y mucho menos, una única especie. La industrialización del mundo en el que vivimos es la principal culpable, ¿pero nadie quiere vivir de nuevo en cuevas no? La cantidad de gases residuales que estamos incorporando a la atmósfera lleva ya décadas alterando el comportamiento del clima, mientras que la gente al cargo de crear las políticas respecto al uso sostenible de los recursos deniega la necesidad de hacerlo. Otro problema importante al que nos enfrentamos es el déficit energético: el carbón y el petróleo siguen siendo ampliamente usados, mientras que se cierran centrales nucleares por malinformación y sensacionalismo sobre los peligros que entrañan. Las energías renovables todavía requieren de muchísimo desarrollo para llegar a competir directamente con las fuentes anteriores, y ya no mencionar los reactores de fusión que solucionarían el problema en un abrir y cerrar de ojos. Si no reaccionamos pronto, estos cambios se volverán irreversibles: 2016 ha roto records, cada mes ha sido el más cálido desde que se tienen registros. La Tierra se recicla a sí misma constantemente pero de manera muy lenta, y o nos adaptamos nosotros a su ritmo, o será ella misma la que se ocupará de ponernos en nuestro sitio. El ser humano ha evolucionado para vivir en el entorno terrestre que conocemos, fuera de él, es muy vulnerable. Si alguien alguna vez lee este mensaje, deberá saber que habremos cambiado, para bien o para mal, o que tal vez ya no existamos. Pero seguramente entenderá el problema al que nos enfrentamos pues es algo que ocurriría en cualquier civilización con un desarrollo tecnológico algo avanzado como la nuestra. Nosotros los humanos somos muy ingeniosos, y espero que de aquí a 50 años logremos solucionar completamente el problema del desarrollo sostenible. Per aspera, ad astra.",X

We see the ""footprint,"" she leaves in the waves of our oceans and the actual physical footprints we are able to leave due to gravity. All of the energy flowing on our planet, in our solar system, within our galaxy, and throughout the entire known universe has always been and always will be in some form, for we know energy cannot be created or destroyed. It changes form, but it remains, including this transmission. Will ""someone,"" receive and decipher in their language, the contents of our transmission and will it make sense in that future to whoever receives it? Knowing that one day life as we know it on our earth will end may make some pessimists wonder why any of this matters as far as a future impact. If we are talking about the near future, and those of our immediate descendants of the next couple of generations, then our interactions with the present environment matters because there will be a direct impact on all life present in that time. As far as the far flung future, there may or not be an earth that sustains life, but there certainly won't be if we continue on our current unsustainable destructive path. This includes pollution, the overuse of land for grazing livestock, and excessive water usage. As long as we argue about what impacts the environment and whether global warming is man-made or a natural part of a cycle of the end of an Ice Age, we won't be using our energy to really have a positive impact or reversing any damage already done. The truth is we don't know what this future will look like. Will humans be in it? Will we have reached the next stage in the evolutionary process? Perhaps life will be more energy and less physical and whoever is in this future will be a highly evolved higher consciousness. I like to maintain hope and wonder at the possibilities and think that the earth will cleanse itself in the long run. The universe, what we know of it, will remain. Energy may change form, but it will still exist, much like these messages.",X

Over many generations of lifetimes we have dramatically increased our knowledge of our activities and seen and felt the resulting impact on the natural environment including the impact on ourselves as living beings. Our understanding of all disciplines of science and their interactions - chemistry, biology, ecology, meteorology, medicine, physics, etc. has expanded greatly over the last 5000 years and particularly over the last 300 years. (Modern man and woman have existed for about 200,000 years.) But even today, although we have advanced understanding of science, we have a long way to go to fully understand and predict the future outcome of our actions at a global scale. Therefore, we presently attempt to control our activities in a manner which we call “sustainable.” However, since our ability to predict global change is limited, we do not fully know if the sustainable actions will reverse all of the environmental damage mankind had already done. We fear we have already caused great harm to the atmosphere which could threaten our existence. I believe we will continue to make progress to understand, remediate, and adapt to our changing environment. We are diverse beings with different languages, religions, education, levels of well-being, politics, and law. These differences have added to the difficulty of forming agreement among all living beings on what actions we need to take to save our planet. Every man and woman recognizes their lifetime is limited. While each of us is alive we try our best to do what we have been taught is right and leave the planet as a better place for the next generation. We want to be optimistic about the world and our lives. During my lifetime I have tried to teach my children, Christine and Kate, the importance of being educated, optimistic, and being good citizens of the world.

Earth is the 3rd planet from our sun located in the milky way galaxy. I would like to express my feelings in a matter that is very delicate to our world in our time, which is the month of july, on the 31st day in the year of our Lord 2016. Our species are in need of help. Our planet is need of help. The question proposed to our existence is this: How will our present environmental interactions shape the future? To try and answer this you must first know a little about our planet and race. According to our scientists, our planet has been around for 4.5 - 5 billion years While our ancestors have been around for about six million years, the modern form of humans only evolved about 200,000 years ago. Civilization as we know it is only about 6,000 years old, and industrialization started in the earnest only in the 1800s. So as a race in whole we may seem old, we are not! We are a very young race. We are very strong willed. We are very determined and family oriented and we have a Soul! Our race is full of emotions which drives our very existence. Human beings feel, they love, they hate and they forgive. Humans can band together for any reason. With 7 billion humans on our planet, and growing, our planets resources are being used in ways the planet has never experienced. The human race is expanding. Humans are reaching for the stars. Humans have this feeling we call curiosity. This makes us wonder what could or might be. So humans investigate, humans go beyond the possible, humans strive to be better, humans want to survive. Humans love Earth, yet the human race has been careless over the centuries. The planet, thanks to the human race, is becoming a factory for our race to better themselves. The human race today wants more out of life than just surviving. Humans try to do the impossible in order to better the human race. Yes, humans are violent, Yes humans are careless and destructive, and yes humans are predators. Humans will kill. Humans have faith. The human race believes in a supreme being that created the cosmos in turn created life. God is the creator. Humans believe that God is in heaven and when His son Jesus, returns to Earth, it will mean the end of times for the human race, as a body. Our God has promised the humans eternal life by means of a soul. The humans that believe this and accept Jesus as their savior will live forever in the kingdom of God. The humans that dont believe this, God promises an eternal life in Hell. A place for the damned. Ruled by Satan, an angel cast out of Heaven by God. The human race is very complex. The human mind is unpredictable, yet is so extraordinary. Humans are delicate and fragile as well as strong and forceful. Humans need help. The planet Earth needs help. The question i stated earlier cant be answered by a human. The human race needs an Ambassador, some Being to witness how and what we are doing to destroy our planet. Give our race advice and help to insure the human races' and the planets' survival. The human race is expanding, and yes the planet can hold and maintain zillions of humans, the planet just cant maintain humans' means of living. I believe that at the current rate we humans are devouring the planets resources, covering the planet with concrete, and destroying the planets oceans, forests, and atmosphere...The human race is putting itself on a course for planetary destruction. The human race needs help to be unified. Please help show us how to come together as ONE world. Not many nations and cultures, or race. All humans are flesh and blood. All humans are born, live and die. So until the human race can become as one, the question proposed cant be answered by a human. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and if possible, please send help to planet Earth!",

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world.

,,,Sting,,,,,,,"If you really want to define civilization it should be a culture that doesn't destroy its environment. If you burn down the kitchen one day and expect to eat the next, it is not even intelligent, let alone civilized.",

,,,UN Rio+20 Summit,,,,,,,"This is the story of how one species changed a planet. The latest chapter of our story begins in England 250 years ago. Fuelled by coal, then oil, several brilliant inventions appeared. They ignited the industrial revolution which spread like wildfire through Europe, North America, Japan then elsewhere. The great railways then cars and highways connected people across the globe. Medical discoveries saved millions of lives. New artificial fertilisers meant we could feed more people. Population rose rapidly. But this was nothing compared with what was to come. The 1950’s marked the beginning of ‘the Great Acceleration’. Globalisation, marketing, tourism and huge investments helped fuel enormous growth. People swarmed to cities which became even more powerful engines of creativity. In a single lifetime, the well-being of millions has improved beyond measure. Health, wealth, security, longevity; never have so many had so much yet 1 billion are now malnourished. In a single lifetime we have grown into a phenomenal global force. We move more sediment and rock annually than all natural processes such as erosion and rivers. We manage three quarters of all land outside the ice sheets. Greenhouse gas levels this high have not been seen for over 1 million years. Temperatures are increasing; we have made a hole in the ozone layer. We are losing biodiversity. Many of the world’s deltas are sinking due to damming, mining and other causes. Sea level is rising. Ocean acidification is a real threat. We are altering Earth’s natural cycles. We have entered the Anthropocene; a new geological epoch dominated by humanity. This relentless pressure on our planet risks unprecedented destabilisation. But our creativity, energy and industry offer hope. We have shaped our past, we are shaping our present, we can shape our future. You and I are part of this story. We are the first generation to realise this new responsibility. As the population grows to 9 billion, we must find a safe operating space for humanity for the sake of future generations. Welcome to the Anthropocene.",
